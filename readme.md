# LeetCode Practice: Ahmed Julkernain 

Every summer I tell myself I am going to start leetcoding. Summer has now become fall and I have finally started. This is a

- **Arrays and Strings**
  - Prefix Sum: 6 problems solved

---

## Plan
- Solve 5–6 **easy** problems for each subtopic (Prefix Sum, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, etc.).  
- Then add 2–3 **medium** problems to practice applying the concepts.  
- Gradually cover all major DSA patterns (see guide below).
